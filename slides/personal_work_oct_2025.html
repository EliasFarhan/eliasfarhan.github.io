## Getting rid of GAFAM
- Moving to Proton Drive instead of Google Drive (photos as well)
- Moving my google chrome bookmarks to raindrop.io
- Making my slides (like this one) with markdeep instead of google slides
- Main laptop at home boots by default on Ubuntu
- Canceled my Xbox Game Pass subscription

---

## What is going to be hard
- Moving my google calendars (6it uses the google suite)
- Moving everything to Linux (Switch dev is Windows only)
- Moving away from gmail
- Moving away from github (self-hosting?) at least the github lfs part
- Moving away from spotify (maybe qobuz?)

# Beach Slap

---

## New features

- New intro/outro for each round
- Players can dash under the net of the beach volley
- Expo mode specifically select "easy" levels when you start, instant join and going back to menu
- Level playlist truly going through all the levels 
- Make the result screen show the score of each slap
- Fix some gameplay bug (a teleport when pre-dash and dash not pressed, bomb or ejecting from sproing not setting the color, invincible player getting slapped by slapped player)
- Upgrade to Unity 6.2.5

## Next steps
- Getting Beach Slap ready for playtesting (big refactor, bots in online mode)

## One more things

Next month, the personal work presentation is going to be done at the Salon des Métiers de Genève live on stage and recorded between 2pm and 4:30pm. We will use the SAE template for the google slides. We will finalize the slides on Wednesday the day before, no last minute change will be allowed!
