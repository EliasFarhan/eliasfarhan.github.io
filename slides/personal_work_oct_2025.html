## Getting rid of GAFAM
- Moving to Proton Drive instead of Google Drive (photos as well)
- Moving my google chrome bookmarks to raindrop.io
- Making my slides (like this one) with markdeep instead of google slides
- Main laptop at home boots by default on Ubuntu
- Canceled my Xbox Game Pass subscription

---

## What is going to be hard
- Moving my google calendars (6it uses the google suite)
- Moving everything to Linux (Switch dev is Windows only)
- Moving away from gmail
- Moving away from github (self-hosting?) at least the github lfs

---

# Beach Slap

## New features

- New intro/outro for each round
- Players can dash under the net of the beach volley
- Expo mode specifically select "easy" levels when you start
- Fix some gameplay bug (a teleport when pre-dash and dash not pressed)
- Upgrade to Unity 6.2.5

---

## Herofest
