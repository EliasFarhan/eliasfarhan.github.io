# Beach Slap

---

## New things

- Correct some bugs with ball and bomb physics
- Adding a lot of effects in the menu
- Fix some gameplay bugs (item getting ejected from the level)
- Upgrade to Unity 6.3.1

---

# I am starting a new small project

---

## Welcome at Houdini's

- I will make a mobile port of my game "Welcome at Houdini's" (as a practice for Beach Slap)
- Using Odin Inspector to create the needed tools
- Using Playfab to get game analytics
- A "Support the dev" DLC

---

# My blog

---

## The blogger life
- I made a post about the Graphics Programming Conference that had a little bit of traction
- Because I had a big hole of posts between 2019 to 2024, I decided to look back to what I did and to add some posts
- You can expect more blog posts to come (mostly posted on Linkedin afterwards so don't hesitate to follow me there)
-- A post about OpenGL ES 3.0
-- A post about the mobile port of Welcome at Houdini's
-- A wrap-up of 2025

---

# Other projects

---

## NekoLib
- I asked Claude Code to make a code-review of the resource.h and it found the same bug that Anthony mentionned
- However Claude Code can say dumb things like move semantics create resource leak (but that's litery unique_ptr implementation)



---

## KwaKwa Jam Collection project
- I want to port my old python2/pygame game to C++ with the same engine I used for SplashOnline
- I will try as an experiment to vibe-code most of it with Claude Code (more like a senior dev talking to a junior)
- Maybe make a Nintendo Switch version
- Here are the three first games that will go through this process:

## Next steps
- Getting Beach Slap ready for playtesting (online disconnect management)
- Going to Sweden at Spelkollectivet after Christmas with other gamedevs
