# Beach Slap

# I am starting a new small project

## Welcome at Houdini's

- I will make a mobile port of my game "Welcome at Houdini's"
- Using Odin Inspector to create the needed tools
- Using Playfab to get game analytics

---

# My blog

---

## The blogger life
- I made a post about the Graphics Programming Conference that had a little bit of traction
- Because I had a big hole of posts between 2019 to 2024, I decided to look back to what I did and to add some posts
- You can expect more blog posts to come (mostly posted on Linkedin afterwards so don't hesitate to follow me there)


---

# Other projects

---

## NekoLib
- I asked Claude Code to make a code-review of the resource.h and it found the same bug that Anthony mentionned


---

## KwaKwa Jam Collection porject
- I want to port my old python2/pygame game to C++ with the same engine I used for SplashOnline
- I will try as an experiment to vibe-code most of it with Claude Code (more like a senior dev talking to a junior)
- Here are the three first games that will go through this process:

![TheLastPromise]()

## Next steps
- Getting Beach Slap ready for playtesting (online disconnect management)

# Thanks for listening!
