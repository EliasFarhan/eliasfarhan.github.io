## Course Overview

Today we'll explore:

* **History of Video Game Business** - From arcades to digital distribution
* **The Game Economy** - How games make money
* **Capital and Funding** - Understanding game development financing
* **Indie Development** - Building games on your own terms

This is a 2-hour journey through the business side of the industry you're learning to build for.

>>> Remember: As programmers, understanding the business helps you make better technical decisions and communicate with stakeholders effectively.

---

## Why Business Matters for Programmers

You might be thinking: "I just want to code games!"

Here's why business knowledge matters:

* **Better Design Decisions** - Technical choices impact monetization
* **Career Opportunities** - Understanding business opens more paths
* **Team Communication** - Speak the language of producers and executives
* **Indie Success** - If you go solo, you'll need to know this

The best game developers understand both code AND business.

---

# Part 1: History of Video Game Business

---

## The Arcade Era (1970s-1980s)

**The Birth of the Industry**

* **Pong (1972)** - First commercially successful game ($8 million in 1 year)
* **Space Invaders (1978)** - Generated over $3.8 billion in Japan alone
* **Pac-Man (1980)** - $1 billion in quarters in first year

**Business Model:** Pay-per-play. Simple, immediate revenue. Games designed for maximum quarter extraction.

>>> Key insight: Arcade games were designed to be hard enough to eat quarters but fun enough to keep players coming back. This tension between difficulty and enjoyment still exists in modern monetization.

---

## The Console Revolution (1980s)

**Nintendo's Game-Changing Strategy**

The NES (1985) introduced:
* **Licensing fees** - Third-party developers paid Nintendo to publish
* **Quality control** - Nintendo Seal of Quality
* **Royalty model** - Nintendo took 30% of game sales

This created the platform business model that still dominates today (PlayStation, Xbox, Steam).

---

## The PC Gaming Rise (1990s)

**A Different Path**

* **Shareware Model** - Doom (1993) pioneered "try before you buy"
* **Direct Sales** - Developers kept more revenue
* **Mod Communities** - User-generated content extended game life
* **CD-ROM Revolution** - Enabled larger, more complex games

**Business Impact:** Lower barriers to entry, more developer freedom, but also piracy challenges.

>>> The shareware model was revolutionary - id Software made more money from Doom's shareware than most retail games made at the time.

---

## The MMO Gold Rush (Late 1990s-2000s)

**Subscription Economy Emerges**

* **Ultima Online (1997)** - First major MMO, $10-15/month
* **EverQuest (1999)** - "EverCrack" addiction, $500 million revenue
* **World of Warcraft (2004)** - Peaked at 12 million subscribers ($180M/month!)

**New Business Concepts:**
* Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
* Virtual economies
* Live operations teams
* Player lifetime value (LTV)

---

## The Mobile Revolution (2007-2010)

**Everything Changed Again**

* **iPhone App Store (2008)** - New distribution model
* **Angry Birds (2009)** - Simple gameplay, massive reach
* **Freemium Model** - Free to play, pay for extras
* **Candy Crush (2012)** - $1 billion revenue, mostly from 3% of players

**Business Shift:** From $60 premium to free-to-play with in-app purchases.

>>> The mobile revolution democratized game development - suddenly anyone could publish globally with minimal cost. But it also made discoverability the #1 challenge.

---

## Digital Distribution Era (2003-Present)

**The Death of Physical Media**

* **Steam (2003)** - Valve's digital storefront
* **Xbox Live Arcade (2004)** - Console digital distribution
* **PlayStation Network (2006)**
* **Epic Games Store (2018)** - Challenging Steam with better splits

**Impact:**
* Lower distribution costs
* Easier updates and patches
* Global instant access
* Platform dependency

---

## The Battle Royale & Live Service Era (2017-Present)

**Games as a Service (GaaS)**

* **Fortnite (2017)** - $5.8 billion in 2021 alone
* **Apex Legends (2019)** - $2 billion in first year
* **Genshin Impact (2020)** - $4 billion in first year

**Business Model:**
* Free base game
* Battle passes ($10-20 per season)
* Cosmetic microtransactions
* Constant content updates
* Community events

>>> Modern live service games can generate more revenue in a month than traditional games made in their entire lifetime. But they require constant development investment.

---

## Current Landscape (2024-2026)

**Where We Are Now**

* **Cloud Gaming** - Xbox Cloud, GeForce Now, Amazon Luna
* **Subscription Services** - Game Pass, PlayStation Plus
* **NFTs & Blockchain** - Controversial, still finding place
* **AI Integration** - Procedural content, NPC behavior
* **Cross-platform Play** - Expected standard

The industry is worth over **$200 billion globally** - larger than movies and music combined.

---

# Part 2: The Economy of Games

---

## Revenue Models Overview

**How Games Make Money**

1. **Premium/Paid** - Pay once, own forever ($20-70)
2. **Free-to-Play (F2P)** - Free game, optional purchases
3. **Subscription** - Monthly/yearly fees
4. **Freemium** - Free base + premium features
5. **Ad-Supported** - Free game funded by ads
6. **Hybrid Models** - Combining multiple approaches

Each model has different design implications and revenue potential.

---

>>> The revenue model should influence technical architecture from day one. F2P games need robust server infrastructure for live operations. Premium games might focus on polished single-player content.

---

## Premium Model Deep Dive

**Traditional $60 Game**

**Pros:**
* Predictable revenue at launch
* No ongoing monetization pressure
* Clear value proposition
* Better critical reception

**Cons:**
* All revenue upfront, limited long-tail
* High price barrier reduces audience
* Piracy concerns
* Post-launch support needs funding

**Example:** *The Last of Us Part II* - $300M development, sold 4M copies in opening weekend.

---

## Free-to-Play Economics

**The Whale Economy**

Player breakdown in typical F2P game:
* **95% non-payers** - Never spend money
* **3-4% minnows** - Spend $1-20 total
* **1-2% whales** - Spend $100-1000s

**Key Metrics:**
* **ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User) - Total revenue / total users
* **ARPPU** (Average Revenue Per Paying User) - Revenue / paying users
* **Conversion Rate** - % who spend any money
* **Retention** - Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 return rates

---

>>> Understanding these metrics is crucial. A game with 100,000 users and 2% conversion at $50 ARPPU makes $100,000. Same game with 3% conversion makes $150,000 - a 50% revenue increase!

## Monetization Psychology

**What Makes Players Spend?**

* **Convenience** - Save time (energy refills, instant completions)
* **Competition** - Be stronger than others
* **Collection** - Complete sets, get all characters
* **Expression** - Cosmetics, customization
* **Progression** - Speed up advancement
* **Social** - Gifts, clan features

**Ethical Considerations:**
* Avoid predatory practices
* Transparent odds (loot boxes)
* Spending limits
* No pay-to-win in competitive games

---

## Battle Pass Economics

**Modern Recurring Revenue**

**Structure:**
* Season duration: 60-90 days
* Price: $8-12
* Free tier + paid tier
* Levels 1-100 with rewards

**Why It Works:**
* Creates FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
* Encourages daily engagement
* Predictable revenue
* Fair feeling - you see all rewards upfront

**Example:** Fortnite Battle Pass has 75%+ attach rate among active players.

---

>>> Battle Passes create a psychological contract: "Play our game regularly this season and we'll reward you." This drives engagement better than random loot boxes.

## Platform Economics

**The 30% Question**

Traditional platform cuts:
* **Steam** - 30% (drops to 25% at $10M, 20% at $50M)
* **Apple/Google** - 30% (15% for small developers <$1M/year)
* **PlayStation/Xbox** - 30%
* **Epic Games Store** - 12% (disrupting the market)
* **Itch.io** - Pay what you want (0-100%)

These percentages dramatically affect profitability, especially for small studios.

---

## Regional Pricing

**Global Economic Realities**

Price of a $60 USD game:
* **Russia** - 1999₽ (~$21 equivalent purchasing power)
* **Brazil** - R$249 (~$45)
* **India** - ₹3999 (~$48)
* **Argentina** - $9999 (~$10 due to currency instability)
* **USA** - $60

**Why Regional Pricing Matters:**
* Market penetration in emerging markets
* Reduces piracy
* Increases total revenue
* Shows cultural awareness

---

>>> Steam's regional pricing can increase your global revenue by 40-60%. A $60 game priced regionally might make less per sale in some regions but sell 5-10x more copies.

## Development Cost Breakdown

**Where Money Goes in Game Development**

* **Salaries** - 60-75% of budget
* **Marketing** - 10-30% (often equals development cost for AAA)
* **Middleware/Licensing** - 5-10% (engines, tools, music)
* **Office/Operations** - 5-10%
* **Testing/QA** - 5-8%

**Scale:**
* Indie game - $50K - $500K
* AA game - $2M - $20M
* AAA game - $50M - $200M+

---

## Marketing Economics

**The Discoverability Challenge**

* **Steam releases per day** - 30-40 games
* **Mobile apps per day** - 3,000+ games
* **Marketing spend for AAA** - Often equals development budget

**Cost-Effective Marketing:**
* Influencer/streamer outreach
* Community building
* Early access/beta programs
* Game festivals (PAX, GDC, indie events)
* Social media presence

**One truth:** The best game ever made will fail if no one knows it exists.

---

>>> Fortnite spent $100M on development and reportedly $100M+ on marketing in the first year. That initial push created the cultural phenomenon. But indie games can succeed with clever, targeted marketing on tiny budgets.

# Part 3: How Capital Works

---

## Bootstrapping

**Self-Funding Your Game**

**Advantages:**
* Full creative control
* Keep 100% equity
* No pressure for specific milestones
* Freedom to pivot

**Challenges:**
* Limited budget restricts scope
* Personal financial risk
* Slower development
* May need side job

**Success Stories:** *Stardew Valley* (1 person, 4 years), *Undertale* ($50K Kickstarter + savings)

---

>>> Most indie developers bootstrap their first game while working another job. It's slow and hard, but you maintain complete control and learn the full development cycle.

## Publisher Funding

**Traditional Game Publishing**

**Publisher Provides:**
* Development funding
* Marketing budget
* QA testing
* Distribution
* Localization

**Publisher Takes:**
* 30-70% of revenue (often 50-70%)
* IP rights (sometimes)
* Creative control (varies)
* Recoupment before developer sees money

---

## Publisher Deal Structures

**Understanding the Terms**

**Advance Against Royalty:**
* Publisher gives you $500K upfront
* You owe that back from your share of revenue
* Only get royalties after recoupment
* Example: At 30% developer share, need $1.67M revenue to recoup

**Profit Share:**
* No advance, split profits 50/50
* Less risk, less upfront cash
* Start earning immediately

**Work-for-Hire:**
* Fixed payment, publisher owns IP
* Like consulting, guaranteed money

---

>>> Read every contract carefully! Many developers never see royalties because "marketing costs" or "platform fees" are deducted before calculating their share. Lawyer up!

## Venture Capital (VC)

**Investment for Growth**

**What VCs Look For:**
* Large addressable market
* Scalable business model
* Strong team
* Competitive advantage
* Path to 10x return

**Typical Terms:**
* Investment: $500K - $5M (seed/Series A)
* Equity: 15-25%
* Board seat
* Liquidation preferences
* Anti-dilution protection

---

## VC: The Good and Bad

**Advantages:**
* Significant capital for growth
* Industry connections
* Business expertise
* Validation

**Disadvantages:**
* Give up equity and control
* Pressure for massive growth
* Exit expectations (acquisition or IPO)
* Misaligned incentives (VC wants 10x, you want sustainable business)

**Reality:** Only ~1% of game studios get VC funding. It's not right for everyone.

---

>>> VCs invest in a portfolio expecting 9/10 companies to fail, but 1/10 to return 100x. This creates pressure to "go big or go home" rather than building a sustainable business.

## Grants and Subsidies

**Government and Foundation Support**

**Examples:**
* **Canada Media Fund** - Up to $750K for Canadian studios
* **UK Games Fund** - £25K prototyping grants
* **Epic MegaGrants** - $5K to $500K, no strings attached
* **Creative Europe** - EU game development support
* **Regional Film Commissions** - Often fund games too

**Benefits:**
* Non-dilutive (keep your equity!)
* Often support experimental/artistic games
* Relatively small amounts but helpful

---

## Crowdfunding

**Community-Funded Development**

**Platforms:**
* **Kickstarter** - All-or-nothing funding
* **Indiegogo** - Keep what you raise
* **Patreon** - Ongoing support
* **Fig** - Combines crowdfunding with investment

**Success Factors:**
* Strong prototype/vertical slice
* Compelling story and vision
* Engaged community
* Transparent communication
* Reasonable funding goal

**Reality Check:** Only ~35% of game Kickstarters succeed.

---

>>> Kickstarter isn't free money - it's pre-orders with accountability. You're promising to deliver, and backers expect results. Failed projects damage your reputation permanently.

## Crowdfunding: Case Studies

**Successes:**
* **Star Citizen** - $600M+ (ongoing)
* **Pillars of Eternity** - $4M (asked $1.1M)
* **Shovel Knight** - $311K (asked $75K)

**Failures:**
* **Mighty No. 9** - Funded $4M, delivered mediocre game
* **Yogventures** - $567K, never delivered

**Key Lesson:** Crowdfunding is validation and funding, but you still need to build a great game.

---

## Early Access Model

**Pay to Play While Developing**

**How It Works:**
* Release unfinished but playable game
* Charge reduced price ($10-30)
* Regular updates based on feedback
* Full launch later at full price

**Advantages:**
* Revenue during development
* Community feedback
* Marketing/awareness building
* Validates market interest

**Risks:**
* First impressions matter - release too early and damage reputation
* Feature creep from community
* Burnout from public scrutiny

---

>>> Early Access success stories like Minecraft, Valheim, and Hades show the model works. But for every success, there are hundreds of abandoned Early Access games that killed their studio's reputation.

## Revenue Sharing & Royalties

**Alternative Funding Models**

**Revenue Share Partnership:**
* Team members work for % of revenue instead of salary
* Common in indie teams
* Everyone invested in success

**Example:**
* 4-person team, each gets 25%
* Game makes $400K
* Each person gets $100K

**Risks:**
* No guaranteed income
* Relationship strain if game fails
* Disputes over contribution vs. percentage

---

## Understanding Equity

**Ownership in Your Studio**

**Key Concepts:**
* **Equity** - Ownership percentage
* **Dilution** - Your % goes down as you raise money
* **Vesting** - Earning equity over time (typically 4 years)
* **Cliff** - Period before vesting starts (often 1 year)

**Example:**
* You own 100% initially
* Raise $1M at $4M valuation → 20% dilution, you own 80%
* Raise another $2M at $8M valuation → 20% dilution, you own 64%

Each funding round dilutes, but increases total pie value.

---

>>> Owning 50% of a $10M company is better than owning 100% of a $1M company. Don't be afraid of dilution if it helps you build something bigger.

# Part 4: Indie Game Development

---

## What is "Indie"?

**Defining Independent Development**

Originally meant:
* Financially independent (self-funded or small funding)
* Creatively independent (no publisher)
* Small team (1-15 people)

**Modern Reality:**
* Some "indies" have $2M budgets
* Some work with publishers
* The spirit of independence matters more than strict definition

**Core Principle:** Creative freedom and ownership over commercial success.

---

>>> "Indie" is more about mindset than team size. It's about making the game you want to make, not what focus groups say will sell.

## The Indie Advantage

**Why Go Independent?**

**Creative Freedom:**
* Make weird, experimental games
* Target niche audiences
* Take artistic risks
* Iterate without oversight

**Financial Potential:**
* Keep more revenue
* Sustainable small successes possible
* Platforms enable global distribution
* Lower overhead means lower break-even

**Learning:**
* Wear all hats
* Understand full pipeline
* Build diverse skills

---

## The Indie Reality Check

**Harsh Truths**

* **Most indie games lose money** - Only ~25% make any profit
* **Takes longer than planned** - Multiply your estimate by 2-3x
* **Marketing is essential** - You must promote actively
* **Burnout is real** - 60-80 hour weeks are common
* **Day job likely needed** - Few can afford full-time development initially

**But:** The successful ones can be life-changing, both creatively and financially.

---

>>> For every Stardew Valley making $24M, there are 10,000 indie games that made $5,000. Go in with eyes open, but don't let statistics kill your dreams.

## Scope Management

**The #1 Killer of Indie Projects**

**Common Mistakes:**
* "We'll build an MMO with 5 people!"
* "We'll make this in 6 months!" (2 years later...)
* "Just add this one more feature..."

**Survival Strategies:**
* Start small - make your 10th game idea, not your dream game
* Minimum Viable Game concept
* Vertical slice first
* Cut features ruthlessly
* Time-box development

**Example:** *Hollow Knight* started as a smaller game, only expanded after early success.

---

## Solo Development

**The One-Person Studio**

**Advantages:**
* Complete creative control
* Keep 100% revenue
* Simple decision making
* Flexible schedule

**Challenges:**
* Everything falls on you (code, art, sound, marketing, business)
* Loneliness and isolation
* Skill gaps
* Slower progress
* No one to catch mistakes

**Tools That Help:** Unity/Godot, Aseprite, BFXR, free music assets, contractor platforms

---

>>> Solo development is appealing but brutally hard. Most successful solo devs have significant experience and use heavy asset reuse or simple art styles. Don't solo dev your first serious game.

## Small Team Dynamics

**2-10 Person Studios**

**Ideal Team Composition:**
* 1-2 Programmers
* 1-2 Artists
* 1 Designer (often overlaps with programmer)
* 0.5 Audio (contractor)
* 0.5 Marketing/Community (often founder)

**Making It Work:**
* Clear roles and ownership
* Written agreements (even with friends!)
* Regular milestones
* Communication tools
* Shared vision

**Reality:** Most successful indies are 2-4 person teams.

---

## Revenue Expectations

**What Can Indie Games Actually Make?**

**Steam Release Statistics (2023):**
* **Bottom 50%** - Less than $5,000 total
* **Top 25%** - $50,000+
* **Top 10%** - $250,000+
* **Top 1%** - $1M+

**Mobile (even harder):**
* **90% of apps** - Less than $1,000/month
* **Top 10%** - $5,000+/month

**Breakout Hits:**
* Stardew Valley - $24M+
* Among Us - $100M+ (took 2 years to explode)
* Vampire Survivors - $100M+ (1 person)

---

>>> Plan for the median outcome, not the lottery. If your game makes $50K, does that sustain your studio? What's your break-even point?

## Marketing for Indies

**You Can't Ignore This**

**The Reality:**
* Development: 50% of your time
* Marketing: 50% of your time

**Effective Indie Marketing:**
* **Build Community Early** - Twitter, Discord, Reddit
* **GIFs/Videos** - Show gameplay constantly
* **Streamer Outreach** - Send keys to relevant creators
* **Demo/Prologue** - Let people try it free
* **Festivals** - Steam Next Fest, PAX, local events
* **Wishlists** - Critical on Steam (aim for 10K+)
* **Dev Logs** - Document your journey

---

>>> Steam's algorithm heavily weighs wishlists. A game with 50K wishlists will get prominent placement on launch day. Start building wishlists 6-12 months before release.

## When to Launch

**Timing Your Release**

**Avoid:**
* Holiday season (Nov-Dec) - AAA saturation
* Major game releases in your genre
* Summer drought (unless you're the only game)

**Good Times:**
* January-March (post-holiday, people want new games)
* September (back to routine)
* Your game festival demo success

**Platform Events:**
* Steam Next Fest (February, June, October)
* Platform sales events
* Themed sale events matching your genre

---

## Sustainability Models

**Making Indie Development Last**

**Portfolio Approach:**
* Build 3-4 smaller games instead of 1 big one
* Each game has higher success chance
* Build audience across titles
* Lessons learned compound

**Service Model:**
* Consulting/contract work
* Asset store sales
* Tutorials/courses
* Patreon/sponsorships

**Slow Burn:**
* Keep day job
* Develop nights/weekends
* No pressure for immediate success
* Build skills steadily

---

>>> Many successful indie studios started with contract work to fund their passion projects. There's no shame in having a sustainable business model that includes non-game revenue.

## Community Building

**Your Most Valuable Asset**

**Why Community Matters:**
* Free playtesting
* Marketing amplification
* Direct feedback
* Emotional support
* Revenue (wishlists/purchases)

**Building Your Community:**
* **Discord Server** - Your home base
* **Social Media** - Twitter for devs, TikTok for younger audiences
* **Reddit** - r/gamedev, genre-specific subs
* **Streaming** - Show development live
* **Newsletter** - Own your communication channel

**Golden Rule:** Give value before asking. Share knowledge, help others, be genuine.

---

>>> The developers who succeed are often generous with their knowledge. Your community becomes your support network, QA team, and marketing force.

## Tools and Costs

**Budgeting Your Indie Game**

**Free Tools:**
* Godot (engine)
* Blender (3D)
* GIMP/Krita (2D)
* Audacity (audio)
* DaVinci Resolve (video editing)

**Paid but Worthwhile:**
* Unity ($185/year for Plus, free for small revenue)
* Unreal (free, 5% royalty after $1M)
* Aseprite ($20, pixel art)
* Substance Painter ($20/month, texturing)

**Other Costs:**
* App store fees ($100/year Apple, $25 one-time Google)
* Domain/web hosting ($50/year)
* Marketing budget ($500-5000)

**Total to launch:** $500-3000 as absolute minimum.

---

>>> You can make a game with $0 budget using free tools. But investing a few hundred dollars in good tools and marketing can dramatically improve your chances.

## Legal Basics

**Protecting Yourself**

**Essential Documents:**
* **LLC Formation** - Protect personal assets ($100-500)
* **Contracts** - For any collaborators or contractors
* **IP Assignment** - Ensure you own all assets
* **Privacy Policy** - Required for data collection
* **Terms of Service** - Define user agreements

**Tax Considerations:**
* Business expenses are deductible
* Set aside 25-30% for taxes
* Quarterly estimated taxes if profitable
* Track ALL expenses

**When to Get a Lawyer:** Before signing any contract or forming a partnership.

---

## Success Stories

**Learning from Indie Hits**

**Stardew Valley (Eric Barone):**
* 4 years solo development
* No marketing budget
* Pixel art kept scope manageable
* Launched at $15, sold 20M+ copies

**Hollow Knight (Team Cherry):**
* 3-person core team
* Kickstarter for $57K
* 2.5 years development
* Launched at $15, sold 5M+ copies
* Constant free updates built loyalty

**Vampire Survivors (Luca Galante):**
* Solo developer
* $3 price point
* Launched early access
* Minimal graphics, focus on gameplay
* Made $100M+

---

>>> What do these share? Reasonable scope, clear vision, strong core gameplay loop, and developers who finished the game.

## Common Indie Failures

**Learn from Mistakes**

**Scope Creep:**
* Started small, kept adding features
* Never finished
* Burned out

**No Marketing:**
* "Build it and they will come"
* Launch day: 12 sales
* Surprised no one knew about it

**Wrong Platform:**
* Console-quality game on mobile
* Mobile game on PC
* Pricing mismatch

**Team Collapse:**
* No written agreements
* Money disputes
* Creative differences
* Someone quits mid-project

---

>>> Every failed indie game teaches a lesson. Read postmortems (gamasutra.com has hundreds). Learn from others' expensive mistakes.

## Your Indie Journey

**Getting Started Today**

**Week 1:** Pick your first tiny project (1 week scope)
* One mechanic
* Simple art
* Finish it

**Month 1:** Build 4 tiny games
* Learn full pipeline
* Get comfortable shipping

**Month 6:** Start your "real" first indie game
* 3-6 month scope
* Use lessons learned
* Start marketing early

**Year 1:** Launch, learn, iterate
* Reflect on what worked
* Build community
* Plan next project

---

>>> The biggest difference between successful indie devs and aspiring ones? Successful ones ship games. Start small, finish projects, build momentum.
