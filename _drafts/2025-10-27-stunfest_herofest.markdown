This month was eventful for [Beach Slap](https://team-kwakwa.com/beach-slap). First stop was Herofest in Bern. We bought a new TV that we needed to setup on the first day. After this littel rush, we could let the game play. I added a special expo mode in the game that automatically reset the game to the title screen, then after a little while shows a trailer, so I don't need to manually intervene.

I also got the chance to have the booth right next to a stage where David Wise and his band were playing. David Wise worked on the soundtrack of Soup Raiders (that we unfortunately paused since then) and it was really nice to see him in the real life (instead that on skype). Here is a selfie of both of us:

I was sick most of the weekend, hiding behind my mask and surviving, but I could see the game getting a good reception.
