As most of you already know, the Soup Raiders game was in developer limbo for a while. With everyone in the team doing their thing, the project is no more. We are releasing the latest demo <a href="https://teamkwakwa.itch.io/soup-raiders" target="_blank">here</a>.

A huge thanks to Julie Baechtold and Camille Bovey, as well as David Wise for their amazing work!
