This week, I went to Breda to attend the Graphics Programming Conference, thanks to SAE Institute. My goal was to delve into more advanced Computer Graphics before starting the module the week after.

Breda is a lovely city, south of the Netherlands, that you can easily access from Schiphol airport by train. Originally, I wanted to go by train from Lausanne with TGV and Eurostar, but in the end it did not work out with my schedule.

The conference is divided in three days, with very technical talks (which I love), some sponsored talks and some more "academic" talks. Sometimes, some talks are concurrent, but because they are all recorded, it is pretty easy to just go to the one that is most interesting for us. Overall, the quality of the talks is really high.

As a teacher, those were the talks that I was the most interested in:
- A Methodical Approach to Profiling & Optimizing Graphics
- ShaderToHuman (S2H) HLSL/GLSL library for debugging shaders
- Getting to know Slang
- Root signatures & shader ISA
- After the Tutorial: Where to Continue your Graphics Programming Journey
Those talks were directly impactful for me for teaching Graphics Programming to my students. I will definitely share them with my students when they are on youtube.

Of course, going to a conference is also a break in the usual day-to-day life and it allows to have the brain breath and find new ideas, so here are the resulting ideas that came out of different talks:
- A Decade of SEED: Lessons from 10 Years of R&D in Games: It made me think of research in the different areas of rendering, computer vision, game ai, physics, and animation. But also EA SEED is part of a big AAA studio and I was wondering what a research lab could look like for indie games. Currently, we mostly rely on Unreal or Unity or Godot (some still have the courage to use custom engine), but the sharing of custom tools and technology could really be improved and it made me think how I could help other devs around me (RGB conf was a try).
