2025 is coming to an end. A lot of things happened for me. I wanted to write a wrap-up and project myself into 2026 with all the new projects.

## Working at 6it.dev

After the initial rush of end of 2024 right after CppCon, I needed to rebalance my work-life balance to be able to continue to work at 6it. I can't really talk about what I am working on, but I could take the time to learn a lot about C++ and API design, as well as production management that I put into practice at SAE Institute with my students. 

Overwork

## ADDON



## Marathon de Genève

![marathon de genève]()

Running a marathon was last year resolution and in the end, I ran the Fribourg by Night trail which was a lot of fun, but also a good realization that after about 2 hours, my body is completely empty and I need a lot of supplies during a long race.

So I registered for the Geneva Marathon in May as a challenge, not really knnowing how it would look like. Maybe one regret is that the training might have not been to the best for a marathon as I was counting on my mental to make me go through.

So fast forward to May the 11th, in the morning, a very sunny day, packed with supplies at the starting line. 

## Sierre-Zinal

People who train marathon usually have a small downtime or depression after the event, as the main goal of the year is done, but I registered for an even crazier race this year after the marathon, so I could not stop traning just yet. 

Registration happened in April and because of the amount of people who wants to register, I needed to be ready on time. When the register button appeared, I instantly clicked and needed to wait 1 hour and 15 minutes to be able to register. I finally had the confirmation, so off to the race.

Sierre-Zinal happened on August the 9th, during a heatwave. Fortunately, my race started at 6:45am, so temperature was at around 20°C. I needed to take a train at 2am. When on board, I realized that I forgot my small trail bag that I had during Geneva Marathon... Unfortunately, I could not go back at home to get my bag and nobody could go back to my place to get it for me and bring it to me on time for the race. In the end, I found a way to bring most of my heavy stuff to the arrival, but used my bigger bag to go up for the first part.

The first part of Sierre-Zinal goes from Sierre to Chandolin. It goes up about 1500m so it is considered the first half of the race. The slope is very intense as soon as we leave Niouc. 

Waiting for my mom



## BIC Fest + awards

A few days after Sierre-Zinal, I took the plane to South Korea, to showcase Beach Slap at BIC festival in Busan. Before that, my gf helped me localize the game to korean, so Beach Slap became 해변의 귓방망이 (which sort of translate to "Slap to ear of the beach"). This title made it very successful, as the title is very funny in korean (everytime I tell the title, I get a big laugh out of korean players). 



## Korean trip

## Herofest + stunfest

Early October, we went to showcase Beach Slap at Herofest in Bern.

I had a week end of October when I took the train to go to Leukerbad, Koln, Geneva, Paris and Rennes. I like travelling by train, but this week was intense.

## Graphics Programming Conference

Pushing the boundries. Trying new things in teaching as well.

## Spelkollektivet

While my gf was going to see her family during the Winter Holidays, I decided to spend this period at SpelKollektivet, a community of game developers living in the Swedish countryside. While the perspective of being with complete strangers for one week and half sort of pertrify me, I still decided to go, such that I could spend some time to work on my own projects.

Gym + running on a treadmill

Why I like to be alone? Japan trip 2022, korean trip this year mostly alone.

## Next year?
