For this year Epic Game Jam, Schrödinger Edition, the theme was not revealed. Or the theme was in a big box and anybody could watch it, but one could choose not to watch the theme. So I made a game about Epic Game Jam on the gameboy, using the tools I developed in the latest patch (blog post about it [here](/jekyll/update/2019/07/15/soup-raiders-jailbreak-patch.html)).
