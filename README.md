# Welcome to Elias Farhan's technical blog

I am the Head of the Games Programming department at the SAE Institute Geneva (https://geneva.sae.edu/). My interests are in game engine, rendering and low-level programming. Hopefully, I will be able to write some blog posts about several projects and some course snippets.
