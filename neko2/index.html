                        **Neko2 Editor**
                           Version 2.00


Welcome to the API documentation of the Neko2 editor for Game Art students at [SAE Institute Geneva](https://geneva.sae.edu/).


Context
==============================================================

During the Computer Graphics module at SAE Institute Geneva, the Games Programming students have to create their own OpenGL rendering engine in C++. Starting 2022, some game art's students started to follow the course to get some technical background on the graphics pipeline. So I created this graphics editor that allow to serialize a pipeline into a scene package that can be played into the player executable.

With this tool, the game art's can implement 3d scene using basic scripting in Python and control the graphics objects of the scene, without hard knowledge in programming. 

Features
==============================================================
The Neko2 Editor features:
- GLSL shaders (vertex, fragment, geometry and compute shaders) 
- Python scripting
- Serialization of pipelines, materials, render passes and framebuffers.
- Modern OpenGL and Vulkan renderer.

Requirement for the editor
--------------------------------------------------------------

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
- [Visual Studio 2022 Redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/redistribution)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)

Graphics Objects
===============================================================

Shaders
---------------------------------------------------------------
![The Shader Editor](images/shader_editor.png)
The shader editor allows to import shaders into our 3d scene. It checks if the shader is valid (compiled with glslangValidator), list the uniforms, inputs, and outputs. You can edit the shader content in the center view (useful for quick fix, but prefer an auto-completion IDE).

When loading a GLSL shader, take care of using the correct extension:
- Vertex shaders: .vert (for Rasterizer pipeline)
- Fragment shaders: .frag (for Rasterizer pipeline)
- Geometry shaders: .geom (for Rasterizer pipeline)
- Tesselation Control shaders: .tesc (for Rasterizer pipeline)
- Tesselation Evaluation shaders: .tese (for Rasterizer pipeline)
- Compute shaders: .comp (for Compute pipeline)
- Ray Generation shaders: .rgen (for Raytracing pipeline)
- Ray Intersection shaders: .rint (for Raytracing pipeline)
- Ray Any-Hit shaders: .rahit (for Raytracing pipeline)
- Ray Closest-Hit shaders: .rchit (for Raytracing pipeline)
- Ray Miss shader: .rmiss (for Raytracing pipeline)
- Ray Callable shaders: .rcall (for Raytracing pipeline)

The editor will parse the shaders to get all the following informations:
- Custom structs
- Inputs: for Neko2, the requirements for vertex input buffers are:
   1. position as vec3 at location 0, 
   2. texCoords as vec2 at location 1, 
   3. normals as vec3 at location 2, 
   4. tangents as vec3 at location 3,
   5. bitangents as vec3 at location 4
      
It should look like:
```````````````````````````````````````````````
layout(location = 0) in vec3 inPosition;
layout(location = 1) in vec2 inTexCoords;
layout(location = 2) in vec3 inNormal;
layout(location = 3) in vec3 inTangent;
layout(location = 4) in vec3 inBitangent;
```````````````````````````````````````````````
- Outputs: in Vulkan, outputs are required location layout.
- Uniforms: in Vulkan uniforms are divided in two categories: push constants and ubo. Push constants can be modified between several draw calls of the draw command but are limited to 128 bytes. Ubo can only be set once per frame on the GPU (it is done before the draw call).
- Samplers


Pipeline
---------------------------------------------------------------
![The Pipeline Editor](images/pipeline_editor.png)
The Pipeline Editor allows to create graphics or compute pipelines from shaders. 

Pipeline serialized data file format is .pipe. There are three types of pipeline:
- Rasterizer pipeline: requires at least a vertex and fragment shaders. 
- Compute pipeline: requires at least a compute shader.
- Raytracing pipeline (only available with Vulkan shaders).

You can give a hint for the type of textures that you want for a given sampler:

![](images/pipeline_sampler.png)

It will then be used when generating the materials and commands from an imported 3d model.


Textures
---------------------------------------------------------------
The following formats are supported to load textures (.jpg, .png, .tga, .bmp, .hdr). For cubemap, the path to the textures are stored in a .cube file.

Framebuffer
---------------------------------------------------------------
The framebuffer contains several color attachments and a depth-stencil attachment (it's more a GL-like abstraction than a Vulkan framebuffer).

Material
---------------------------------------------------------------
![Material Editor](images/material_editor.png)

Materials bind pipelines and textures together. For textures, their sources can be:
- A loaded Texture from an image file
- A framebuffer attachment (color or depth)
When generated from a model, the material can have their textures automatically linked with the proper sampler, given the Pipeline set the hint on the Pipeline Editor.

Mesh
---------------------------------------------------------------
A mesh is an abstraction of the vertex input buffers. There are three types of primitive meshes:
- Quad
- Cube
- Sphere

A mesh can also be generated from a 3d model. 

Model
---------------------------------------------------------------

3d models can be imported from a file. You can find a list of all the supported imported formats [here](https://assimp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/introduction.html).

From the editor, we can generate the Materials and Draw Commands associated with a 3d model, according to a specific pipeline:

![](images/model_generate_draw_command.png)

Draw Command
---------------------------------------------------------------

A draw command links a material with a mesh, with drawing functionalities.

Render Pass
---------------------------------------------------------------

A renderpass contains some subpasses. Each subpass have a framebuffer and some draw commands.

When commands are generated from a Model and a Pipeline, you can import all of them at once with the "Import From Model Command" button:

![](images/render_pass_import_from_model.png)

Scripts
---------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts are Python or C++ System that implements that can implement those methods:
- begin()
- update(dt: float)
- end()
- draw(draw_command: DrawCommand)
- on_key_down
- on_key_up
- on_mouse_motion

Scene
---------------------------------------------------------------

A scene is the ultimate structure of the engine. It contains a renderpass and some scripts. The render API is either OpenGL or Vulkan and is selected at scene creation.

The editor is segregated by scene (only one scene can be opened and edited at once).


Python API
===============================================================

You can use Python scripts to make your scene more interactive, the minimum requirements for a script are:
```````````````````````````````````````````````
from neko2 import *


class PythonScript(System):
      def begin(self):
         pass

      def update(self, dt: float):
         pass
      
      def end(self):
         pass
```````````````````````````````````````````````
Your class has to implement at least those three methods:
- begin(): Called at the scene loading
- update(dt): Called at each graphic update, do not draw inside it!
- end(): Called at the scene unloading
- draw(draw_command): Called at each graphic update, use this to draw with a draw command!

Draw Command
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DrawCommand is a wrapper around a draw command. Here is the methods' and attributes' list:
- bind(): bind the textures from the material.
- set_float(name, value)
- set_int(name, value)
- set_vec2(name, value)
- set_vec3(name, value)
- set_vec4(name, value)
- set_mat4(name, value)
- draw(): in Vulkan, the draw call will update the push constants and the buffers of the ubo to the GPU, before the actual draw call.
- name: can be used to differentiate draw commands. For example:

```````````````````````````````````````````````
def draw(self, draw_command: DrawCommand):
   if draw_command.name == "CubeCommand":
      draw_command.bind()
      draw_command.draw()

```````````````````````````````````````````````

When setting up Draw Command, you can decide if the draw call is going to be automatic or manual through script. When manual, an important method can be overriden in Python:
```````````````````````````````````````````````

   def draw(self, draw_command: DrawCommand):
      pass

```````````````````````````````````````````````
