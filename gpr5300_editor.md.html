Welcome to the API documentation of the GPR5300 - Computer Graphics editor for Game Art students at [SAE Institute Geneva](https://geneva.sae.edu/). You can download it here: (https://github.com/SAE-Geneve/GPR5300_920_Editor).


Context
==============================================================

During the Computer Graphics module at SAE Institute Geneva, the Games Programming students have to create their own OpenGL rendering engine in C++. Starting 2022, some game art's students started to follow the course to get some technical background on the graphics pipeline. So I created this graphics editor that allow to serialize a pipeline into a scene package that can be played into the player executable.

The GPR5300 Editor features:
- GLSL shaders
- Python scripting
- Serialization of pipelines, materials, render passes and framebuffers.
