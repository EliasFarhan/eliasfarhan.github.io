# Unite 2025 talk proposal resource

I gave two versions of this talk:
- Faire un jeu en ligne multijoueur avec un syst√®me rollback, at ADDON 2025 ([slides](https://eliasfarhan.ch/ADDON2025))
- A Simple Rollback System in C++ : The Secrets Behind Online Multiplayer Games, at CppCon2024 ([slides](https://eliasfarhan.ch/CppCon2024), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkcGa-Xw154))

For Unite 2025, I intend to focus on our Unity game "Beach Slap" and make a public repository with our interface (obviously, I do not want to open-source the repository of our game).

Here is the repository of the C++ project that was used for the CppCon2024 talk.
- [Splash Online](https://github.com/EliasFarhan/SplashOnline): A C++-20 reimplementation of Splash Blast Panic with online multiplayer.
