I officially represent the Swiss-French community in the Swiss Game Developer Association. I presented my ideas to bridge the two communities in front of 11 voting members. Swiss Train Jam and Röstigraben Game Jam are on the program for this year, as I want an active way to mix the two communities together to see future collaborations arise.
Yasemin Günay from Kobold Games approached me to present their games and company to the Swiss-French Game Developer Meetup. It is a huge step to consider the position of the Swiss-French community in the SGDA, because with me on board, it legitimates the association in the Romandie. A lot of nice festivals are on schedule and I look forward to participate in them, and already thanks the SGDA for their work to acquire low-cost place for indie game developers.
