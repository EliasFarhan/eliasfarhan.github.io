![Sisyphus](/images/2015/06/Sisyphus.jpg)

So, after a semester of research for my master project, here is the second version of my prototype. It contains three different stages:

- The Leap of Faith

- The Sisyphus' Myth

- The Falling Choice

It is still an early prototype, so it can feel too frustrating at some point. You can download it here (Windows 64-bits): <a href="/games/Faith0.2.zip" target="_blank">Faith0.2.zip</a>

You can also find my Master Project Disposition here: <a href="/docs/dispo.pdf" target="_blank">dispo.pdf</a>
