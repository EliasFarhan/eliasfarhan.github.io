Today, I went to the train station to catch my 8:11 train. I was stressed so when I ran when I arrived at the train station to be exactly at the good time. Then, I saw the panel and the train was eleven minutes late. I told myself: \"Damn, why did I run? I\'ll have to wait eleven minutes now\"

Then the announcer explained the situation: \"Someone threw itself in front of the train.\"

It is common to do a one-minute silence for someone who is dead, but for me, it was eleven minutes. This person\'s life made me lost eleven minutes in my daily schedule.

How do we approach such a situation? We don\'t care, because we have a train to take. His life compared to the 7.3 billions people on Earth is negligible. If we go more local, compared to the 8 millions Swiss, it is still insignificant. I mean there are in average 226 children who will be born today, so 1 against 226 is still low. Compared to the 1.4 millions ZÃ¼richer, still little. Then when you arrive to the level of his family, it becomes important. There are brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, cousins, uncles, aunts, ... waiting for him/her to arrive home tonight.

For me, it is that simple. The value of the life of this person who threw itself in front of the train is 11 minutes. No more, no less...
