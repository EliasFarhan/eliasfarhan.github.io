Right after [Busan Indie Connect](/jekyll/update/2025/08/19/bicfest.html), I spent some times visiting South Korea, starting from Busan:

Then I went to Gyeongju, the capital of the Silla kingdom back in the day:

Heading back to Seoul to go to the Seoul Indies meetup, where I presented Beach Slap:

Afterwards, I went eastwards to Gangneung:

After a very long trip with several trains, I arrived in Jeonju:

I joined with my gf in Gwangju:

I visited the penguin village, named after the elders living there that look like penguins walking:

We went to see a baseball match in Daegu:

I even prepared some gimbap:

Before finally, heading to Seoul:

That was it for my trip to Korea. Still a lot of details that I could not put in this post, but looking forward to come back and eat all the food.
