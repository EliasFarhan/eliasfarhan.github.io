After going to the US, I participated in several events to show <a href="http://playsbp.ch">Splash Blast Panic</a>. I also spent a lot of time to finish my master thesis, that I will soon release for everyone to read. Meaning I did not have the time to write on this blog. So here is what I did:

I went to Polymanga at the booth of the <a href="http://siea.ch/fr/">SIEA</a>, with Oniroforge. I do not really enjoy the mood of the Polymanga, as it is mostly young adolescents screaming for nothing, we do not call that the dumb age for nothing. At the same time, we organized a tournament during the PolyLAN, and that is way more interesting for me, as a game developer, to see people not only playing the game for 10 minutes, but trying to master the game to win. From the tournament, I recorded one of the most crazy match of Splash Blast Panic, the B-Final between Cutips and StrawberryPie:

And here are the winners: 1. Djeeb, 2. Lacryna, and 3. Cutips after his wonderful match.

After all those events, I took the opportunity to work with Christian Schmidhalter, from <a href="http://www.misterwhale.ch/">Mr. Whale's Game Service</a>. We created Dash Catch during the week-end and you can play it here: <a href="https://teamkwakwa.itch.io/dash-catch">https://teamkwakwa.itch.io/dash-catch</a>.

Before finishing the master thesis, I then went to the Fantasy Basel. We showed Splash Blast Panic like last year, and we could celebrate the one year production anniversary. The only downside was that the target audience was not that interesting.

Finally, after my master thesis was over, I went with a strong Swiss delegation to the Stunfest festival in Rennes, France. And that was an awesome event. The Stunfest started as a versus fighting festival and opened up to a game festival, with some of the best players from France. I got beaten at my own by very good players who used clever tactics. There as a concert show from PERTUBATOR, one of the composers of Hotline Miami and the week-end finished with a Street Fighter 5 tournament. What a month!
