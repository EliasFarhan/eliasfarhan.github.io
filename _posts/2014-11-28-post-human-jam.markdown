I will be in Monthey for the [Post-Human Jam](https://web.archive.org/web/20150625094140/http://www.symposium-pi.ch/#!game-jam/c1dxm). We will represent Team-KwaKwa with [Dan](https://www.artstation.com/daniorgulescu) and [Tenchi](https://tenchi.team2xh.net/). Seems the jam is more oriented through the cyberpunk genre and we will only have 24 hours to make a game (from Saturday noon to Sunday noon). In this thematic genre, we also made the Cyberpunk Jam back in March, with ([STRIDERS](http://teamkwakwa.itch.io/striders)), one of our best games. I will maybe stream some developments on my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/kraklegrand) (depending on the bandwidth).
