Last week-end, I created "<a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/the-rise-of-akeicha/73900">The Rise of Akeicha</a>" for <a href="https://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-09/421/">Bacon Game Jam 9</a>, the reddit gamejam. It is a point'n'click adventure where you play as Akeicha, a woman living in a post-apocalyptical world where humanity lives underground. Of course, because it is a gamejam, we could not put everything on it and Mariam made an extraordinary work to draw everything. It is also the first game where I am insipred to write a little short story about it, we'll see how it goes.
