Today, in the Research Workshop, we had to finish our master project O_O

So I took the opportunity to play with the concept of my master project and create Faith 0.1, a first version of the game I am trying to achieve.

You can play it <a href="/games/Faith0.1.zip">here</a>.

It's Windows 64 only. WASD to move & jump.

Don't hesitate to record you playing, I like feedback.
