During 3 days, I was in the Devonshire with 11 friends of mine. We had a beautiful home in Halberton.

The first day we went to the south. Visiting Totnes, we ate the typical gourmet sandwich. I went to a cloth shop where I bought a pair of gloves from a nice Londonian who lived in Totnes since 23 years. He indicated me a beautiful road following the sea. So we went there:

Blackpool Sands is an enormous beach in the Startbay. We contemplated the sea before going to Starpoint (see the first picture).

The Saturday, we went north to Lynton, a beautiful little coastal city. This is where we ate typical british food:

Yeah, Fish\'n\'Chips, so tasty, wow! We stop for the sunset:![Sisyphus 1](/images/2015/03/image10.jpg

On Sunday, because of the International Women\'s day, we went to Prime Mark (or Markt for Liliane). But there is no need for pictures to see this.

A nice week-end with golden friends.
