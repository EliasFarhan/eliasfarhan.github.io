We created a game in 4 hours. That was the challenge of the ZHdK NewsGames Hackathon of the 6th of May.Â  NewsGames are a special genre between Serious Games and Traditionnal Video-Games, about news, events or political situations (Papers Please can be considered a News Game).

We decided to create a game about immigration, with a very macabre concept. The player tries to rescue Africans refugees who are drowning. At the end of the game, a newspaper indicates how many people died.

I really like the adrenalin of those types of challenges, so it was a nice afternoon doing "Fresh Off The Boat". You can play it here for Windows 64bits: <a href="/games/FreshOffTheBoat.zip</a>
