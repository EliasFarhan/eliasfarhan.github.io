I remember <a href="http://eliasfarhan.ch/?p=489">my post</a> from last year. After one year and a half of exhausting jamming and master study, I was starting to get bored by game jams. But I did a game on GameBoy and suddenly I realized something important. Game jams are not just about creating games. It is about living extraordinary experience (painful one too). Oh God I was happy when I compiled the last rom and uploaded it (with my shitty upload bandwidth, I was actually happy to create a 256kB gb rom instead of the usual 100mB .zip files that takes 20 min to upload home).

Jamming is easy for me now, so I try to go outside of my comfort zone on the game ideas. <a href="http://eliasfarhan.ch/?p=584">Welcome at Houdini's</a> for example made me try something new in terms of gameplay. As a beginner game developer, I was focused on creating game in a certain genre. Now, I have several prototypes that I want to continue as game project. For example, I want to have a Soup Raiders TRPG with crazy cartoon mechanics inspired by Disgaea, Fire Emblem and the like.

Jamming is about creating new ideas out of nowhere. I tend to want to create games in the genre I like, but game jams force me to try anything. If my colleagues want to try a specific idea, I bow to that and start to think how I will code it. With the Master in Game Design, I can also think to better way of implementing a mechanic, in a way, I became a gameplay programer.

This month of May was super busy at my job and I did not jam, but I don't feel I missed something. I was always trying to make one game jam a month. It was my way of being creative. Now, I am also trying new engines (for example, I want to get my hand on Godot 3 as an alternative to Unity) and new platforms (GameBoy, Nintendo DS, Arduboy...).

So, in short, I can't stop the jamming!
