For this year's Global Game Jam, Kevin and I combined our forces with <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidJavet">David Javet</a> and Mathieu Pellet from Team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattagahaka_Jantu_of_Anuradhapura">Tchagata</a>, and joined later on Saturday by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/aden-16">Antoine Tuloup</a>. We jammed with 78 other jammers in Yverdon-les-Bains' castle:

Over 36,000 jammers in 702 sites across 95 countries have created over 7,000 games during this Global Game Jam week-end all around the world, with everyone starting at their own timezone. As soon as the theme went out at 6:00pm (theme: Waves), we decided to focus on a Puyo Puyo-like type of games, but with items instead of combos attacks. Here is a photo of the complete team:

The Genre of the game is defined as Waifu Puzzle Battle for Beach Domination, it can be considered as a more ecchi version of Puyo Puyo (generally more targeted towards kids normally). Here are some screenshots or the game:
