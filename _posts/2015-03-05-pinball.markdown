For the ETH course \"Game Programming\", we were in an arcade pinball bar. The ETH course is a cooperation from ZHdK and ETH with support of Disney Research Project. The goal of the course is to create a game in a semester. The theme of the game should be link to \"evolution\". I will talk more about my experience about this course in an other post.

So, with the ETH people, we went to Outlane, an underground bar with a collection of pinball arcade machine. The owner went through the history of games and more precisely the history of pinball machine.

After this little presentation, we had all the pleasure to play old and new pinball machines, with free beers (which does not improve performances).

My favorite one was the Indiana Jones pinball machine and the Metal Slug 3 Arcade machine.
