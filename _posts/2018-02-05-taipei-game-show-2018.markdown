After some months of production hibernation, we showcased Splash Blast Panic at the Ludicious and the Taipei Game Show on the Nintendo Switch. The game is running great and we are in the final phases before release. There are still things to do like localization, age ratings, setup the consoles stores, etc...

The Taipei Game Show was a final opportunity to check if players that do not know anything about the game still like the final version. For that, it was a success:

We were in the corner of the Indie House zone, which was clearly not the best location, even though people were coming and were playing, but there is a clear problem with the repartition of the booths and the neighbor booth was HyperX and there were doing annoying loud noises with their chinese female speakers all day long, probably worse than TeamSpeak at Gamescom. After an event like Pax West, where all the booths are respectable loudness-wise, it makes me wonder if the indie booths should also have really annoying loud sounds too to counter, or that a sound limitation policy should be implemented.

Overall, the Taipei Game Show was a nice event, but I will probably not go back next year, because of the noise and the very consumerist aspect of the festival, oriented for free-to-play and without any interesting goodies, except Sony Playstation t-shirt for $30 (same prizes as in Switzerland).

I also took one week holidays after the conventions and went to visit some nice sites:

It was a nice time, Taipei is a nice city to spend some holidays and change your mind, especially because I did not take holidays in the Christmas holidays to work on Splash Blast Panic.
