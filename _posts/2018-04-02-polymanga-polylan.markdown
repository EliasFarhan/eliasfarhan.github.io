The Easter week-end was a long one. It started on Friday morning at 8:00am at Montreux to get our entrance and setup the booth at Polymanga. For a second time after Japan Impact, we had the chance to exhibit our game on the Nintendo of Switzerland booth. And it was PACKED pretty quickly after the opening, to the point we, the developers, had to stand at about 5 meters from our stand to check it. There were just too much noise and people. But from kids to parents, everybody was enjoying the game.

On Saturday, I took the day to make a tournament at PolyLAN where 19 players competed with outsiders and veterans of the game alike. The level was higher than last year, with some known players getting eliminated during the Quarter Finals. You can check all the matchs in the link below:

On Sunday and Monday, we finished Polymanga. We had the chance to have the developers from Retimed next to our booth and we could discuss and eat together. We meet some players at the booth and overall, the experience was positive. Unfortunately, I got the disease of the year the week after Polymanga.
