The best conference I followed in the last two years\" said Stefano Vanotti, the Research Workshop responsible. That is the feedback we received for the conference we organized. The conference can be described with this image:

That was the close keynote of the conference. I was sort of the host for the show, presenting every lecturer. We began with a welcome from [@Philo](https://twitter.com/PhilomenaSchwab), the Chair from the #NotInYourMouth conference.

Maria suggests to build our own Testing Network. [#NotInYourMouth](https://x.com/hashtag/NotInYourMouth?src=hash%5C). After, we went to the three different workshops: Oudentity, Fear Shame and Event Design. I went to the Fear Shame Workshop, because why not?

We had a lot of fun. The teachers were impressed with our motivation. That was a good day.
