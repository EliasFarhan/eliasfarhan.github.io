*Next to Malmö train station*

During a cold May month in Switzerland, we went north to get warmer and showcase Soup Raiders at the Nordic Game Conference. I took the whole week to be able to visit on the first day. Our airbnb was a bit outside the city, but it takes less than 30 minutes to go throw the entire city. It is also 30 minutes by train from Copenhagen airport.

On Tuesday, we had the chance to visit several game studios like Massive, Avalanche, King, Tarsier, and all the lovely people at the Game Habitat. We visited the Game Assembly school and damn I was jealous.

*Each student has a desk with a computer and two screens.*

They have 5 curriculum in Swedish:
- Games Programming
- Game Art
- Game Animator
- Level Designer
- Technical Artist

The programmers build their own engine and make every 3 months with the other sections a game. So by the end of the education they did 8 games, while working on their own engine in C++.

But of course I was not there to just visit studios and schools...

So the goal was to meet as much publishers as possible and so I participated to the Publisher Market where we had 5min to pitch our game. This was fast and there were moments where I was pitching my game three time in 15min.

I also had the chance to talk in a small panel talking about the evolution of game programming languages starting from Assembly to C++. I was not expecting to talk there, but they ask the public and so I talked about what we do at the SAE Institute.

Malmö is a wonderful city, very similar to Lausanne, but by the sea and close to Copenhagen airport, one of the biggest airport in Europe. Even if I am comfortable in Lausanne, it is hard not to want to move there and work for those awesome companies there.

Bye bye Malmö
