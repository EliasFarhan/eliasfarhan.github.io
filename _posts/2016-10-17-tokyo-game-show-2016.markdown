Tokyo, the Mecca of okatus, gamers and game developers alike. We were surprised to be selected for the Tokyo Game Show 2016 with Splash Blast Panic and for me, it was an opportunity  to get back to this city that I love so much. I went there in 2014, when 4 friends of mine did this incredible journey of the Transiberian and at the same time, visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Fukuoka, Busan and Seoul in one week.

I remembered some things from my previous travel, especially Akihabara (or Akiba). Damn, I discovered so much more of Akihabara again. All those stores, all this animation, this mood is just incredible. But the rest of the city is as incredible. I did a whole round of the city for the week I had at my disposal before the TGS began. I went to Shinjuku, Harajuku, Shibuya (where I bought awesome ZeroAudio headphones that are unavailable in Europe and super cheap compare to the quality), Nakano, Ueno, Asakuza, I spent some time at the Imperial Palace's Gardens (just next to our location):

I went back to the Meiji Shrine and enjoyed the silence of the forest in the middle of the city. I went to an onsen, separated male and female, where you have hottube bath, and you are naked :D (No photos sorry).

I ate so many good things. My first supper was a nice classical ramen:

And I enjoyed with <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisDeneos">Christophe Galati</a>, some takoyaki:

Every time that I think about food in Japan, I just want to go back there, just for one dinner. But I did not go to Japan just for food and for fun. I went there for the Tokyo Game Show.

4 days of exhibition, 2 days business days with 10'000 people per day, and 2 days of public days with 100'000 people per day. For me, I am biased by the comparaison with the Gamescom that was an awesome experience. So of course, compared to gamescom, I was disappointed. Though there was still a lot of people:

Japanese players won't come to your booth if you do not speak Japanese to them. You had to grab them and put them in front of the game. I enjoyed meeting developers from other countries, and meet Cristian or <a href="https://twitter.com/drdavient">Dave</a> that I met at the GDC previously in March. Damn, I feel proud to be part of such an open and friendly community that is game development.

Japanese players are overall better than European players. The irony was when they were playing well and then were just saying: "I am not good at this game."

To finish, I wanted to also share a little anecdote. Kevin and I were playing several times some rounds of Splash during the whole week. He always beat me and I did not know why. On Sunday, I played seriously, without exhalting when I was winning like I used to do. I beat him twice and the third match I manage to put a perfect match. Several Japaneses behind us applauded me while Kevin was stopping them. It was a good feeling, like the overall TGS.
