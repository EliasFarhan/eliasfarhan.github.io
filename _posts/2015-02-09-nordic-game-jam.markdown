Nordic Game Jam is the biggest local game jam in the world. It happened in Copenhagen, Denmark.Â  731 game developers went to make a game in 48 hours.

I went there without expecting something, just meet people and make games. I found a couch-surfing by [Mike]("https://twitter.com/mikekrolik?lang=en), one of the organizers of the jam.

I visited the city the Thursday afternoon. It was a bit cold, but not as cold as Switzerland with the wind. I went up in the Observatory to have a sky-view of the city. What I found was out of place was the big pipes of the industry building not very far from the center. I then went to the little mermaid, near the 16th fortress. We don't have such building in Switzerland so it was nice to find this.

Finally for Thursday, I went to Christina, because the Pre-Jam Party occurred there. You could smell the cannabis, but that\'s the purpose of the area. At the party, I met [Wiktor](https://twitter.com/WiktorWasowski), a polish 3d artist from Poznan. Their delegation came with bus, ferry and bus. They even did a little jam during the ferry travel, with \"Pirate\" as a theme. I also met [Phillipp](https://twitter.com/phillipphoenix), a Danish programmer and [Richard](https://twitter.com/richy486), an Australian organizer. I'm not much a party guy, but it was to meet all those new people.

Friday was the talks day. I followed the one of [Chris McEntee](https://twitter.com/chrismcentee?lang=en), from Ubisoft Montpellier, talking about difficulty in game. I was excited by the talk of [James Portnow](https://twitter.com/JamesPortnow?lang=en) and he delivered. He asked why we were doing game, with inspiration and all

Finally, the theme was revealed and it was obvious. Then began the group forming process, where everyone just talked and all. I joined a group with [Veronyka](https://twitter.com/veronykajelinek?lang=en) and [Andreas](https://twitter.com/Andreasfr?lang=en). We discussed ideas of a game until late and I went alone on a wash machine maze game. That was my first mistake of the week-end, because as I had missed my last bus, I was all alone with my game idea. I should have joined an other team of programmers/game designers to play a bit with the new technology available.

On Saturday I did two mini-games, Bubblevious and Wash Machine Simulator. I was a bit depress, because I was alone doing my game, though Veronyka and Andreas gave me the assets.

On Sunday, I presented my two games. People were just great. I mean everyone, even the shittiest game had some humor in it. People laughed at my presentation, so it was not that bad.

I then took the plane back at Copenhagen to go back at Geneva. I was not in the finalist (hopefully), but next year, if I have the money to go back, I should stay and leave on Monday. Arriving at the gate, I realize that I forgot my AC Adapter at the presentation. I went really mad. I guess I have to go back next year.
