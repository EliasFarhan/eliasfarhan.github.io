This month was eventful for [Beach Slap](https://team-kwakwa.com/beach-slap). First stop was Herofest in Bern. We bought a new TV that we needed to setup on the first day. After this littel rush, we could let the game play. I added a special expo mode in the game that automatically reset the game to the title screen, then after a little while shows a trailer, so I don't need to manually intervene.

I also got the chance to have the booth right next to a stage where David Wise and his band were playing. David Wise worked on the soundtrack of Soup Raiders (that we unfortunately paused since then) and it was really nice to see him in the real life (instead that on skype). Here is a selfie of both of us:

I was sick most of the weekend, hiding behind my mask and surviving, but I could see the game getting a good reception. Between the game and the music, there was also an indie award. As I was too sick, I asked my colleague to go while I stayed at the booth. He came back with an prize:

With [BIC Fest](/jekyll/update/2025/08/19/bicfest.html), that's two awards in a row. I think that with Beach Slap, we finally arrived to an multiplayer arcade game that is not too weird and has a broader appeal (especially compared to Splash Blast Panic). There is still a lot of work to do, but I am looking forward for next year's release and see the reactions of people playing it.

Later in the month, I went to Stunfest in Rennes, France. Usually, Stunfest used to happen in May. Funny enough, there was a Japanese player that, back in the day, said that he won Stunfest and when people argued his name was not in the winner's list, he said that he won the fall-edition of the Stunfest, that did not exist. Well now it does! There have been a lot of changes since the first time I went to Stunfest to showcase a game. This year was a new beginning.

The booth was free, we were a lot of indies from all around France (except me from Switzerland). However, being a multiplayer game, I was not given enough space for 4-player so I was always a bit in the way. There was an evening where all the games were presented:

As nobody told me anything, I still went to see the awards, knowing that we probably did not win anything. I was a bit upset that nobody told me there was presentations about all games going on and I only realized while listening to all the presentations that my turn would actually come and it did. In the end, we did not win an award (two out of three is still very good).
