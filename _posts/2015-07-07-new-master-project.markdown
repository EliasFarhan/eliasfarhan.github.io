After one month of thinking, I decided to change the topic of my master project. As a passionnate and <a href="https://twitter.com/OneGameAMonth">#1GAM</a> addict, I feel more comfortable to do a master thesis on gamejam. With this topic, I can continue working on Super Splash Fistiguffs and participate to crazy gamejams like Nordic Game Jam or Train Jam. I am even thinking of doing a gamejam during the master exhibition at the end of the master: Exhibition Jam.
