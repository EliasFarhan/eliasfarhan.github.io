Since the end of the Ludum Dare 31, I continued to work on <strong>Super Splash Fisticuffs</strong> who is now renamed as <strong>Project Splash</strong> until we find a better name. The gameplay is a bit more sophisticated and smooth. I added keyboard+mouse control and a dynamic way to choose them in the Character Menu. Also, like Smash Bros, I added a Out Of Camera Circle with the Head of the Player Character. I could go on, but now that Kevin and I decided to go on with this project, we began a devlog on TIGSource: <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=49243">http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=49243</a>

So yes, we enter full-production. We will organize a tournament with a special prize for the winner around August, so stay tuned for more infos.
