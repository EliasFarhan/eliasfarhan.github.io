Game jams are mostly gameful events with playful outcomes. It means that game jams are regulated events that allow participants to create crazy games. But often, as we participate in game jams, the event by itself is not fun or memorable, except for exceptional and extraordinary moments. In the continuum of Ludus (game with rules, like video-game, chess) and Paidia (game without rules, role-play), what if game jams become Paidia events, what if game jams become play jams.

In this context, let me present the Frankenstein Play Jam. Inspired by the <a href="http://eliasfarhan.ch/?p=301">Kid Game Jam</a>, anyone can come and create assets (images, animations, music, sounds), that I have to include in a final game and that is the only constraint. There is no theme, anyone can do any assets (respecting the Swiss Law, which is pretty unrestrictive). The goal is a merge of several art style in a Frankenstein monster manner.
