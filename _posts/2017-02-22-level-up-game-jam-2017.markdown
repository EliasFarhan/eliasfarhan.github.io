Before I went to GDC, I had the 10th anniversary of my exams from college on February 16th and it is a tradition from my school to invite all the schoolgirl and -boy to check their exams again. It is always to see all those faces back, the good friends, the old crushes. But that was not the final destination of the day. After a nice pizza at the restaurant, I run to get a train to Fribourg for the <a href="http://www.lvlupgamejam.ch/">Level Up Game Jam</a> to join <a href="https://twitter.com/Gyuma97">Alexis Simonetta</a>. The brainstorming process in the train while Alexis was in Fribourg was painful, we could not agree on a specific idea, while we were both going in the same way. Finally arrived, we settled on a definitive game idea. And I went to sleep.

The day after was hard work, play-testing and a lot of laugh. I went back home to record some voices using the famous technique of borborygmus like in the Sims. Finally on Saturday, we released the game and left it for the jury. I had to leave early, so I could not get the result directly after. But one of the jury wrote me that his wife played 3 HOURS STRAIGHT. How? Why? Really?

The game we made is called "Welcome at Houdini's". You play as a merchant mage who can mix elements to create objets. You can play the jam prototype here: <a href="https://teamkwakwa.itch.io/welcome-to-houdinis">https://teamkwakwa.itch.io/welcome-to-houdinis</a>

Alexis and I are really proud of the prototype and we will maybe continue to work on it to make a MORE-THAN-THREE-HOURS experience. We won the Sound Design prize of the Level Up Game Jam, which is actually a surprise as we are not professional Sound Designer nor Composer. To conclude, with an unusual gameplay, we manage to create a very solid entry and we left a grumpy team photo:
