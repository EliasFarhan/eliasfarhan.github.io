With my new job, comes new responsibilities. I had the task with Game Department to organise a game jam at the SAE Institute Geneva. I had to select the theme and kickoff the event. You can see my interview in French here:

For the theme, I choose Mechanical Love for the combination of two interesting concepts. I really hate blank theme or too specific ones. In the list of very bad theme: <a href="http://eliasfarhan.ch/?p=26">NGJ15</a> with the theme "Obvious" and the <a href="http://eliasfarhan.ch/?p=207">Epic Game Jam Round #2</a> 2015 with the theme "90% water, 10% evil and 5% skin". People were happy about the theme and scattered around the school to work on their project.

With <a href="https://twitter.com/JulieKlement">Julia Klement</a>, we decided to take literally and to make a robot-dating game sort of like Tinder with robots. We took some characters from Splash, added other characters. Here is the cast:

The game is called "Robot, mon chéri" and you can play it on Android and Desktop here: <a href="https://teamkwakwa.itch.io/robot-mon-chri">https://teamkwakwa.itch.io/robot-mon-chri</a>

I leave you with the shy robot ending, enjoy!
