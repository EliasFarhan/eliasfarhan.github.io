It took some time to write this post-mortem. It was a long week those last ten days from 8th to 18th of August, but with a little team, we manage to create a little game called Black Whiskers. Without transition, here is the post-mortem:

<b>What went right</b>
<ul>
	<li>Super pro team. We were efficient, high-quality assets. Awesome no?</li>
	<li>We were all motivated bythe initial idea and could expand on it (by adding two more levels)</li>
	<li>I was able to put dumb jokes in the game and some crazy narration.</li>
</ul>

<strong>What went wrong</strong>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Asthom had some trouble with his schedule, so sound design suffered a bit</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">A first level and gameplay WAY TOO HARD for a simple game jam entry (probably due by the fact that Hack'n'Slash is not the genre for Game Boy)</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Some problems with pixel-perfect on Unity</li>
</ul>
In the end, it was still a very funny gamejam, we laughed a lot with Alexis. Now, I need to do a game jam without cats.
